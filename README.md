This will be a public repository of blocked_domains.csv files for uploading to user accounts on Mastodon. There will also be provision for documents which are not ready for upload, pending reformatting and removal of surplase text. The main idea is to generate upload-ready files and also to have them sorted and classified for different use cases. Not everyone will want to block a wide range of domains and some people will prefer multiple accounts which have different levels of stringency in blocking. These files will reflect various sources. The appearance of a domain on any blocklist is in no way a decision or judgement on the part of this account holder, it merely reflects what the original source of the blocklist chose to block. Many such blocks will be arbitrary - which is the whole point of presenting multiple files here, so users of Mastodon can decide for themselves what to block and what not to block.
