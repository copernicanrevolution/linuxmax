# options to block
This project will be a public repository of uploadable lists for Mastodon users. 
The priority is lists of domains you may block at the user level.
How to do this is explained at my article posted on Medium and Substack. 
Basically, you just need a simple text file saved as .csv
This file is then uploaded on your Mastodon account.
The tricky part is to find the list of domains you wish to block and then to format it correctly.
Many Mastodon instances publish their block list on their about page under the heading "Moderated Servers".
These lists often include surplus comments. 
In order to upload the block list you need to remove everything except basically the URL of the domain you wish to block.
This then allows you to block hundreds of domains that may not already be blocked by your instance for various reasons.
Some instance admins are reluctant to mass block sites based upon the advice of more experienced admins and in some cases for good reason,
Some instance admins over-block.
For instance, some block other instances merely because they are "too big to moderate". But such instances may have a strong moderation team.
If you like to post strong defense of the under-dog in some context you may be targeted by some nasty trolls.
To pre-empt such targeting it may be wise to make such remarks from an account that has what I will call a User-Enhanced-Blocklist.(UEB)
You can also run a parrallel account with virtually no blocks on it, and choose an instance that does not block very much (they are out there!)
From such an unprotected instance, you can simply lurk. This Lurker Account might be termed a "Non-Posting Surveillance Account" (NPSA).
WHAT YOU WILL FIND HERE
Eventually I would like to provide pure ready-to-upload "blocked_domains.csv" files for uploading to user accounts on Mastodon. 
These can be identified as to source and the philosophy of the source. 
There will also be provision for documents which are not ready for upload, pending reformatting and removal of surplus text. These can simply be raw copypast from various server "About" pages.
These documents will not be upload-ready but you can use them for a more granular view of why various instances are considered block-worthy. 

END REVISION
ADDENDUM: Residual text from earlier draft of this readme.md file. 
The main idea is to generate upload-ready files and also to have them sorted and classified for different use cases. Not everyone will want to block a wide range of domains and some people will prefer multiple accounts which have different levels of stringency in blocking. These files will reflect various sources. The appearance of a domain on any blocklist is in no way a decision or judgement on the part of this account holder, it merely reflects what the original source of the blocklist chose to block. Many such blocks will be arbitrary - which is the whole point of presenting multiple files here, so users of Mastodon can decide for themselves what to block and what not to block.
